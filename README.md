### Goals
- Game engine for the console
  - Realtime input
  - Realtime drawing

- Game using the engine _(this is where **NADC** comes in)_

### Premise
This is a small project started for testing out [pdCurses](http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/). It later evolved into a game-engine with the result of **NADC**. 

## Requirements
[Visual C++ Redist for VS 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) (x86)
