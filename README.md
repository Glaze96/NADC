# NADC - "Not Another Dungeon Crawler"

### Goals
- Game engine for the console
  - Realtime input
  - Realtime drawing

- Game using the engine _(this is where **NADC** comes in)_

### Premise
This is a small project started for testing out [pdCurses](http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/).

The game engine has now wrapped pdCurses into easy-to-use functions and classes. As i've explored pdCurses my oponion is thats it's overall a good little library, atleast for me, as it can **atleast** push 30 frames per second for a 150x90 window. The library is simple and can be learned in 1-2 days.

### Result
So what have the project involved into?
One of the results is that I've made a **game engine** that uses the console as a window. All compiled into a static library.
The end goal, for this projects, is obviously [NADC](http://i.imgur.com/PwNBtsm.png?1).
