# NADC - "Not Another Dungeon Crawler"

##### Premise
This is a small project started for testing out [pdCurses](http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/).
The pdCurses "phase" is over and if you want my opinion on it: it's good, as it can pump out 30 frames per second for a 150x90 window. The api is simple and can be learned in 1-2 days.

##### Result
So what have the project involved into?
One of the results is that I've made a **game engine** that uses the console as a window. All compiled into a static library.
The end result, for this projects, is currently an **_unfinished_ dungeon crawler**.
