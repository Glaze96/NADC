# NADC - "Not Another Dungeon Crawler"

### Goals
- Game engine for the console
  - Realtime input
  - Realtime drawing

- Game using the engine _(this is where **NADC** comes in)_

### Premise
This is a small project started for testing out [pdCurses](http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/). It later evolved into a game-engine with the result of **NADC**. 

### Result
One of the results is that I've made a **game engine** that uses the console as a window. All compiled into a static library.
The end goal, for this projects, is obviously [NADC](http://i.imgur.com/PwNBtsm.png?1).
